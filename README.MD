# Software Support Resume Template

This repository features a LaTeX resume template tailored for software support roles. It's the same format I've successfully used to land multiple interviews. The design emphasizes technical skills, project experience, and accomplishments in a clean, structured layoutâ€”similar to the widely recognized "Jake's Resume" style.

## Overview

### Features

- Clean and minimalistic design.
- Easy to customize and tailor for different job applications.
- Sections for technical skills, work experience, projects, certifications, and education.
- Thoughtfully structured to highlight your most important qualifications.

## How to Use

1. **Prerequisites:** Install LaTeX distribution (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX), or create an Overleaf account.

2. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/software-support-resume-template.git
    cd software-support-resume-template
    ```

    - You can also simply copy paste this into Overleaf!

3. **Edit the Resume:**

    - Open `main.tex` in your preferred LaTeX editor.
    - Customize the content under each section (skills, experience, projects, education) according to your own details.
    - Modify the styling, fonts, or colors as needed.

4. **Compile the Resume:**

    - Compile the LaTeX file (`main.tex`) using your LaTeX distribution.
    - This will generate the PDF output (`resume.pdf`) with your updated resume.

5. **Preview and Print:**

    - Review the `resume.pdf` to ensure everything appears as expected.
    - Print or save the PDF to share with potential employers.
